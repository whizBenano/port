                    I am a frontend developer, a product and experience designer
                    and my motto is "Keep it elegantly simple" because I so much 
                    love simple and meaningful designs. I am over 10 years experienced 
                    with designs and have a solid background in graphics design.
                    I use tools like XD or Figma for design and prototyping 
                    before doing the actual coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strongly believe that continuous learning and challenging 
                    myself to do better will make all the difference, I am a fast 
                    learner and can easily pick up new skills. I am easily motivated,
                    inspired and also willing to follow my passion.
                    
                    I have a great sense of aesthetics which affects my colour choices 
                    and overall design in order to achieve user friendliness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, 
                    hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. Iâ€™m a fast 
                    learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different 
                    projects and roles with relative ease.
